The diff shows that the entire file `src/services/customers/components/tabs/CustomerTransactionsTab.tsx` should be deleted (moved to `/dev/null`). Since this is a file deletion diff, the result would be an empty file or no file at all.

However, since you asked for the complete file content that would result from applying the diff correctly, and the diff indicates complete file deletion, the correct result would be no content.
