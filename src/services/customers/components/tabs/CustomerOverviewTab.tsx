The diff shows that the entire file `src/services/customers/components/tabs/CustomerOverviewTab.tsx` should be deleted. Since the diff is removing all 100 lines of the file (indicated by `@@ -1,100 +0,0 @@` and the target being `/dev/null`), the result of applying this diff would be an empty file or no file at all.

However, since you asked for the complete file content that would result from applying the diff, and the diff deletes the entire file, the correct output would be empty content.
